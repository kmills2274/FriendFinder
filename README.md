# FriendFinder

DREAM PHONE | Friend Finder is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- (basically a dating app). This full-stack site will take in the results from the users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users, and a preset list of "friends". The app will display the name and picture of the user's best overall match. The theme is based on "Dream Phone"- which is a personal favorite board game from my childhood! The landing page even features a video of the original board game commerical from 1992! Ready for a throwback?! Check it out now!
